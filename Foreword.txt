The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem, proposes a sequence for any positive integer. 
According to this conjecture, if the number is odd, it will be multiplied by 3 and then increased by 1. 
If the number is even, it will be divided by 2.

For instance, let's consider an example starting with the number 5. 
Since 5 is an odd number, following the conjecture, we will multiply it by 3 and add 1, resulting in 16. 
As 16 is even, we will divide it by 2, getting 8. 
Continuing this process, we divide 8 by 2 to get 4, then 4 by 2 to get 2, and finally 2 by 2 to reach 1.

Upon reaching 1, the sequence enters a loop known as the 'four, two, one loop.' 
The sequence continues in a repeating pattern: 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, and so on.

This loop occurs for all positive integers following the Collatz Conjecture. 
Although it remains an unsolved mathematical problem whether this sequence eventually reaches 1 for all starting positive integers or if there exists a counterexample leading to an infinite loop.
